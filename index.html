						I was born in South Korea and came to the states when I was 3 years old.  I grew up in New Jersey and graduated from Eastern Michigan University with a Bachelors degree in Business Administration with a concentration in Accounting.  Afterwards, I started working at Verizon Wireless as a Customer Service Representative and eventually moved on to become a Sales Representative.  I then transitioned into my current role as a Senior Analyst-Performance Assurance for Finance Operations.  I am currently pursing an MBA in Management Information Systems through the University of Arizona and a Coding Certificate through Rutgers University.  In my past time I enjoy watching and playing sports, reading an interesting book or watching a good movie.  I also enjoy traveling whenever possible.
